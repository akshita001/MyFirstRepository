### Predict the future

- I am going to speak about the topic ```"Predict the Future.."``` 
- When we look at what will happen in future or "forecast" something in future, then we are referring to ```"Predicting events in future"```. It is important to understand past events in order to predict future effectively.
- For example, weather forecasting. When we look at weather.com then we see that city wise weather predictions are provided with various details such as minimum temperature, maximum temperature, humidity, UV index, wind direction, pressure, status of the day such as ```rainy, cloudy or sunny etc.``` 
- While there could be many such examples, lot of analysis are needed to come up with these predictions. 
- This will help in many ways for us so that we can plan our travel, we can be prepared, we can plan for many related tasks such as agriculture and so on.
