## Writeup Themes ("Predict the future")

I am going to speak about the topic ```"Predict the Future.."``` When we look at what will happen in future or "forecast" something in future, then we are referring to ```"Predicting events in future"```. For example, weather forecasting. When we look at weather.com then we see that city wise weather predictions are provided on minimum temperature, maximu temperature, humidity, whether it will have status of the day as rain or cloudy or sunny etc. We understand, it takes certain specific past events or information and analyzes those to come up with this prediction. This will help in many ways so that we can plan our travel, we can be prepared, we can plan for many things such as agriculture and so on.
